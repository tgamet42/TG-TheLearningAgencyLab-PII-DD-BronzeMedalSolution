    "a. The sample submission and public submission both achive their best scores at the highest threshold for their individual scores at a threshold of 0.9400\n",
    "b. The sample submission score drops only with false positives increasing at thresholds above 0.9400 to 0.9600 tested first at 0.9700, however the public LB score fluctuates still high indicating a combination of more false negatives being converted to true positives at a rate that sustains the score as false positives rise until the threshold of 0.9951 is exceeded.\n",
    "c. The sample submission is not useful for detecting a drop in true positives (and thus rise in false negatives) below a threshold of 0.9400. The public leaderboard however shows for a maximum score from thresholds of 0.9600 down to 0.9400, and stability down to a threshold as low as 0.9100.\n",
    "d. If the public set of 25% of the test data is a well represented portion of the total test set, then the other 75% will produce a similar result. However, this is likely not the case as the larger dataset is likely to contain some outliers neither training covered,or the smaller dataset pre-validated for establishing the threshold for the best score. As a result, only the first ensemble threshold picked will be v27 with a public LB of 0.971 from a threshold of 0.9412. This may just be an overfit point,though it also seems plausible that a best case occurs when the false negatives to true positive conversion rate peaks the near highest score is likely reached. My conjecture is that the tipping point is not on a bell curve, but rather skewed in favor of the best score being on the lower end of thresholds.\n",
    "e. The model is stable for a threshold of up to 0.9950 and down to 0.9100. My goal is to cover maximizing the stable region of thresholds so I'll select the other two entries at the top and bottom of the 0.970 LB scores.\n",
    "f. The second model select is v9 at a threshold of 0.9600.\n",
    "G. The third model selected is what is detected as the bottom (lowest threshold) that still produced a 0.970 high score in the samples taken. This is at version 20 with threshold 0.9300.\n",
    "h. Each of the selected models was run with a .6 and .4 weight distribution for each of the two models. All 3 pairs of tests showed a stable outcome in each cases, with an even split (.5 each) doing as well or slightly better than either imbalance. This gives me a bit more confidence that the models are stable, though that is just a conjecture."

The rewrite seems to have little impact on wall time and so I will halt optimzation of the loops in favor of exploring inteferencing and ensemble based improvements."
